<h3><center>Presgrip Cine Title Sets</center></h3>

<p>

<p>
During the boom of amateur filmmaking in the mid-20th century (the 1950s and 60s), the company adapted their core product&nbsp;— removable and reusable letters&nbsp;— to create the Presgrip Cini Title Sets for 8mm and 16mm cine film; these sets enabled amateur film-makers to easily create professional-looking titles and captions for home movies.

</p>
   
<p>
Presgrip offered several different versions of their Cine Title Sets, catering to various budgets and needs of the amateur filmmaker, the contents of which typically revolved around a core set of reusable components designed for easy filming. The main feature of any Presgrip set was the lettering system itself:

- ​letters and numbers: these were usually white plastic characters that came in large quantities (a full alphabet and often common punctuation marks) and were mounted on sheets or in a segmented tray for organization

- ​the board/screen: a title board or screen where the letters would be mounted which often featured a ribbed or slotted surface to keep the letters neatly aligned

- ​backgrounds: to add variety, sets often included different colored backgrounds (mainly red, blue, and green) that could be swapped out on the board; these allowed for contrasting colors to make the white letters pop on film

- ​"celluloid" filters: some of the more complete sets included a set of colored celluloid or plastic filters; these could be placed over the title to add color effects or tints to the title sequence when filmed

- ​instructions and layout guides: The original kits always came with an instruction manual and sometimes a layout-reference card to help the filmmaker center their titles correctly within the camera's frame (especially important for older 8mm and 16mm formats)
